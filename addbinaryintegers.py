"""
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers a and b, 
stored in two n-element arrays A[0:n-1] and B[0:n-1],
where each element is either 0 or 1, 
a = the SUMMATION of A[i]*2**i and b = the SUMMATION of B[i]*2**i.

The sum c = a + b of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an
(n+1)-element array C[0:n], where c = the SUMMATION of C[i]*2**i.

Write a procedure ADD-BINARY-INTEGERS that takes as input arrays A and B, 
along with the length n and returns array C holding the sum"""
